BACKGROUND
==========

The Internet Movie Database (IMDb) is an international organization whose 
objective is to provide useful and up to date movie information *freely* 
available on-line, across as many systems and platforms as possible. It 
currently covers over 110,000 movies with over 1,500,000 filmography entries
and is expanding continuously. For more information on the IMDb as a whole, 
send e-mail with the subject "HELP FAQ" to <mail-server@imdb.com>

The information in the database comes entirely from official sources, press
kits, agents and most importantly from its users. If you find the service 
useful, the best way to show your appreciation is to add more movie information
to the database. We need your help to enable the IMDb to grow and keep it up 
to date with the latest releases as well as  to fill in some of the gaps for 
older movies.

This is a guide to submitting information to the database via the mail-server
interface. This gives you one address to which send your additions across the
whole database and a choice of two formats depending on how familiar you are
with the system.

The WWW front-end to the database provides a form filling interface to the 
additions system. The completed forms are mailed to the same central collection
address so this guide also serves as a useful explanation of the WWW forms.

|Comments on this guide are welcome and should be directed to the IMDb
|help desk <help@imdb.com>

                      -------------------

THE EASY TEMPLATE BASED INTERFACE
=================================

This section gives details of the simplest way to submit additions to the
database. There are two forms of the templates interface: one for adding on a 
title by title basis and one on a name by name basis. There are no complicated
formats to learn and hopefully everything is self-explanatory. If you have a 
small number of additions or aren't familiar with the organization of the 
database, this is the interface for you.


Title Template Interface
------------------------

If you have copies of your favourite movies at home, why not help to complete 
the information on them directly from credits of your copy? Just take a look 
at the instructions below, enter the missing information in the format 
described and send it off.

To submit title data using the interface, follow these simple instructions:

 (1) the first thing you need is a template containing the current details of
     the movie you wish to submit additions for. You can request a template by 
     sending e-mail with the subject or body containing lines of the form:

TEMPL TITLE <title>

     to <mail-server@imdb.com>

For example,

TEMPL TITLE Vertigo (1958)
TEMPL TITLE Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994)

 (2) load the returned template into your favourite editor and follow the
     instructions contained in the template to add your data. There are no 
     complicated formats to learn, just follow the comments and add your data!

 (3) once you have finished editing the template, mail it back to the server -
     the reply address and subject are already set-up to do this, but in case
     you lose the mail-headers, just set the subject to "UPDATE TITLE" and
     send the file to <mail-server@imdb.com>

That's all there is to it! 


Name Template Interface
-----------------------

To submit data for a person using the new interface, follow these simple 
instructions:

 (1) the first thing you need is a template containing the current details of
     the person for whom you wish to submit additions. You can request a 
     template by sending e-mail with the subject or body containing lines of 
     the form:

TEMPL NAME <surname>, <firstname>

     to <mail-server@imdb.com>

For example,

TEMPL NAME Grant, Cary
TEMPL NAME Davis, Geena
TEMPL NAME Hitchcock, Alfred

 (2) load the returned template into your favourite editor and follow the
     instructions given in the template to add your data. There are no 
     complicated formats to learn, just follow the comments and add your data!

 (3) once you have finished editing the template, mail it back to the server -
     the reply address and subject are already set-up to do this, but in case
     you lose the mail-headers, just set the subject to "UPDATE NAME" and
     send the file to <mail-server@imdb.com>.

Again, that's all there is to it! 

                      -------------------

INTRODUCTION TO THE KEYWORD INTERFACE
=====================================

The keyword interface is the most flexible additions interface but can be 
difficult to master if you aren't familiar with the organization of the
database. If you have a small number of additions you may find the template 
or web based interfaces easier to use.

Additions are mailed to the movie mail-server where they are batched up and
forwarded to the IMDb team for processing every Thursday. You will receive a 
receipt summarising your data and listing any lines which don't conform to 
the required format.

To use this interface your message should be sent to the additions address:

   <add@imdb.com>

and contain lines in the formats described below. Please support the database 
by sending in any information which you notice is missing. 

If submitting an entry that is too long to fit on one line then split
it across multiple lines and place a continution marker as the very last
character on a line. The marker is the \ character. The additions interface
will then reconstruct the line for you - without such markers data will be
corrupt and therefore rejected. 

Wrapped line example: 

GUEST
De Jesus, Wanda|"Spider-Man" (1995)|Dr. Silvia Lopez|\
(voice)|Spot, The|1996|

Note: Without the continuation marker the above will be rejected. 

If this guide appears too complex please consider the template based interface
described in the previous section, however, if you do decide to use this 
interface, please take the time to read this guide and follow the formats 
described. Data which does not conform to the standard format is likely to be 
rejected, although the server will let you know if this happens.

Finally, please note that the data has to be processed by the team member(s)
responsible for the section(s) you've added to so there will be some delay
before it is included. In most cases this will be about 1 week after we 
receive the data, but it does vary so please be patient.

Details of when each section was last updated are available on-line in the
web interface at:

  http://us.imdb.com/update_info

                      -------------------

KEYWORDS
========

Each group of additions should be preceeded by a keyword to indicate which
section of the database they are for - keywords include ACTOR, ACTRESS,
CAST, DIRECTOR and PLOTS. Each keyword should be on a line of its own and 
subsequent lines will be extracted by the relevant database manager.

You will receive an acknowledgment from the server on receipt of your data 
which will show how many lines for each keyword were received. The bottom
of the acknowledgment will list any lines which did not conform to the formats
and hence were rejected.

IMPORTANT NOTE:  If your message contains a signature it can confuse the
mail server.  Please ensure that your message contains the keyword, END or
QUIT, before any signatures.

                              -------------------

TITLE AND NAME FORMATS
======================

Names
-----
|Names in additions for the filmography and biography sections should generally
|be given in <surname>, <first name> order. For example:
|
|  Grant, Cary
|  Hitchcock, Alfred
|  De Niro, Robert

This is also true for Japanese, Chinese and other names that usually are
written <surname> <first name> and therefore need only a comma in between,
but no switching. For example:

  Gong, Li ( not <Li, Gong> although credits read <Gong Li> )

Here are further example names to illustrate some special cases:
 
  Name                 | Comments
  ---------------------|------------------------------------------------------
  Cobb, Randall 'Tex'  | If a person is credited with a nickname we use single
                       | not double quotes around the nickname
  ---------------------|------------------------------------------------------
  Robards Jr., Jason   | Don't forget the final "." after Jr and Sr. Also no
                       | comma before Jr./Sr.
  ---------------------|------------------------------------------------------
  Clive, E.E.          | No space between double initials
  ---------------------|------------------------------------------------------
  Riva, J. Michael     | One space between single initial and name
  ---------------------|------------------------------------------------------
| van Ackeren, Robert  | For multi-part names please use the capitalization 
| Van Dyke, Dick       | used in the credits on a name by name basis.
| ---------------------|------------------------------------------------------
| Bont, Jan de         | Split multi-part names into the ordered prefered in
|                      | their country of origin. 'Jan de Bont' is Dutch where
|                      | the local convention is 'Bont, Jan de'
| ---------------------|------------------------------------------------------

Titles
------
All titles should include their initial year of release have leading 
articles ("the", "a", "an" in English) moved to the end in order to allow 
correct alphabetical sorting. For example:

  Pulp Fiction (1994)
  Room with a View, A (1986)
  Terminator, The (1984)
  Affair to Remember, An (1957)

The same rule applies for all other languages. For example:

  Alleinseglerin, Die (1987)        ->  German
  Momento della Verità, Il (1965)   ->  Italian
  Amor brujo, El (1967)             ->  Spanish
  Bandeirantes, Os (1960)           ->  Portugese
  Ergostasio, To (1982)             ->  Greek

also watch for abbreviations of articles:

  Atalante, L' (1934)               ->  French

All titles are assumed to be movies unless otherwise indicated as follows:

  "xxxxx"        = a television series, e.g. "Twin Peaks" (1990)
  "xxxxx" (mini) = a television mini-series, e.g. "Lonesome Dove" (1989) (mini)
  (TV)           = TV movie, or made for cable movie, e.g. Duel (1971) (TV)
  (V)            = made for video movie, e.g. Steve Martin Live (1986) (V)


Name/Title Duplication
----------------------
In rare cases two movies with the same title have been released in the 
same year. In such cases we include (19XX/I) for the movie released first and
(19XX/II) for the one released second. For example:

  Black Rain (1989/I)
  Black Rain (1989/II)

Similarly, if two different people have the same name, we use Roman numerals
to distinguish between them. For example:

  Williams, John (I)   is the actor from the 1950s
  Williams, John (II)  is the composer (often scores Spielberg's movies)


Uncredited Contributions
------------------------
If a person is not listed in the credits of the movie (eg: a cameo appearance
for actors or a role too small to be listed) please use the attribute:

  (uncredited)

For example:

  ACTOR
  Abraham, F. Murray|Bonfire of the Vanities, The (1990)|(uncredited)|Abe Weiss|

Also if someone is billed under a different name, please use the attribute:

  (as name)

For example:

  ACTOR
  Fishburne, Laurence|Cadence (1991)|(as Larry Fishburne)|Stokes|15


Character Sets
--------------
|The IMDb now supports full ISO-Latin-1 character sets as well as the standard
|ASCII set.  In order to submit ISO extended characters, ie e acute (é)
|you should configure your mailer to support the QUOTED PRINTABLE standard.
|If you are unsure how to acvhieve this please contact your local support.
|
|If you cannot configure your mailer to support ISO characters then you
|can still submit ISO data by using the standard HTML markup for ISO
|characters, ie to submit e acute, put  &eacute; in your text and we'll
|map it to the correct character.  Please refer to
|
|  http://www.imdb.com/News/iso_switch
|
|for the full HTML -> ISO markup table.

                      -------------------

ACTORS AND ACTRESSES SECTIONS
=============================

Keywords
--------

 ACTOR   = actors additions 
 ACTRESS = actress additions
 CAST    = actor or actress additions
 CHARA   = character name additions for entries already in the database ONLY

Format for ACTOR/ACTRESS/CAST
-----------------------------

 <name>|<title>|<attributes>|<character name>|<order>

where:

 <name> is the actors name in <surname>, <firstname> order. Please note
        the space after the comma as in: "Grant, Cary". 

 <title> is the title of the movie or TV-series in which the actor 
         appeared, please include the year of release as part of the title
         (see examples below).

 <attributes> records any award nominations or wins and other notes. Example 
              attributes include:

   (voice)        =  only a voice contribution (eg for animated movies)
   (uncredited)   =  no on-screen credit given
   (as ....)      =  credited under a different name
   (AA)           =  academy award winner (best actor)
   (AAN)          =  academy award nominee (best actor)
   (S:AA)         =  academy award winner (best supporting actor)

   (GG)           =  golden globe winner (best drama actor)
   (GGN)          =  golden globe nominee (best drama actor)

 <character name>  is the character name of the actor.

 <order> is a number to record the position in which the actor appears in
         the credits (1=star billing)

Notes
-----

 - Apart from the <name> and <title> all these fields are optional, but please 
   leave the "|" separator for any blank fields, otherwise the some of the data
   may be lost.

 - Please split additions for actors and actresses into two separate sections
   with the appropriate keywords. If you aren't sure of someone's gender, use
   the CAST keyword instead. 

 - Guest appearances in TV-series are NOT eligible for the main actors and
   actresses list. The person must have played a recurring role across a 
   number of episodes in order to be included. See the section describing the 
   guest appearance section for an alternative method of adding this type of 
   information.

 - Please only credit individual names. For example, if all the members of
   a particular rock group appeared in a movie then include them under their
   individual names and not the name of the whole group.

 - The actors and actresses sections are for people only. No animals.

 - Remember the rules above about the (uncredited) and (as ...) attributes

 - To add an attribute to an existing entry, just re-add the entry and 
   include the attribute (ie: there is no need to delete the existing entry
   first)

 If the entry for which you wish to submit a character name information
 is not already in the database you MUST use the ACTOR/ACTRESS/CAST keyword
 instead, otherwise the data will be lost!

 Please do not supply character names all in lowercase or all in uppercase
 as they do not read very well when displayed, ie use:

  CHARA
  Travolta, John|Pulp Fiction (1994)|Vincent Vega

|   writing team with names linked by an ampersand ("&") is considered a
|   writing unit, and wrote their contribution to the screenplay in
|   collaboration.  Writers separated by "and" were not in direct
|   collaboration, and in all likelihood are writers of successive drafts
|   of the screenplay.  It is virtually certain that they never even met,
|   let alone talked about the script.
|
|   2.  First and second (and third, etc.) writing credit.  According to
|   WGAw guidelines, the first writing unit to appear in the credits is
|   the one which has had the most effect on the finished product, then
|   the next most important, etc.
|
|   The sequence number is three numbers, separated by commas.  When the
|   first two numbers are the same, the writers are connected with "&"; when
|   the first number is the same and the second number is different, the
|   writers are connected with "and".  The first number is used to separate
|   different attributes (story, segments, etc.)  For example, at this writing
|   the credits on Chairman of the Board (1997) read "Story by Turi Meyer & Al
|   Septien; screenplay by Turi Meyer & Al Septien and Alex Zamm".
|
|   This shows up in the database as:
|
|   Meyer, Turi|Chairman of the Board (1997)|(story)|1,1,1
|   Septien, Al|Chairman of the Board (1997)|(story)|1,1,2
|   Meyer, Turi|Chairman of the Board (1997)||2,1,1

       or special occasional, guest appearences in a TV-series. 

    <character name> is the character name of the actor. Do not include
       descriptive text about the character, simply the
       name of the character. If unknown, leave the section empty. 

    <attributes> records any special notes but in most cases will be empty.
       Example attributes include:

         (voice)      = only a voice contribution (eg for cartoons)
         (uncredited) = no on-screen credit given
         (as ....)    = credited under a different name

       Do not use the attributes section to describe the character played!

       use descriptive text as a substitute for the actual title. 

    <original air date>  The date the episode was aired in the country that
       produces the show. The format for air-dates is m/d/yyyy, eg.

  Apart from the name and title all these fields are optional, but please
  leave the "|" separator for any blank fields, otherwise the some of the data
  may be lost.

  be rejected. 

  If the actor is not listed in the credits please include an (uncredited)
  attribute. 

  If the show is a cartoon, please include a (voice) attribute. 

  Please only credit individual names. For example, if all the members of a
  particular rock group appeared in a show then include them under their
  individual names and not the name of the whole group. 

  If a person appears as themselves on a show, list their character name as
  himself or herself, not Guest, Host, etc. 

  This section is for people only. No animals.

|TITLELOCK
|=========
|
|The spelling and format of titles in the database can be locked against
|further corrections, ie they are correct, even though other sources may
|differ, by using the TITLELOCK keyword.
|
|For each title to be locked add a line of the following form:
|
|current correct title| 
|
|For example:
|
|Navigator: A Mediaeval Odyssey, The (1988)| 
|
|IMDb uses the title as it appears onscreen in the credits as the definitive
|format. Do not lock a title without viewing a copy of the movie and confirming
|it yourself as other sources use different standards for the title.

 <primary name>|<aka-name>

Description
-----------

  People are sometimes billed under several different names during their 
  careers. The NAKA keyword is used to submit this kind of information. 

| <primary name> is an existing name recognised by IMDb
|
| <aka-name> is the alternative name you want to add. This is not the civil
|    name of people as opposed to the stage name, unless the civil name was
|    also used as a stage name for some time (civil names go to the biographies
|    list). And it is not any other name such as a nickname if it was never
|    used in credits. Usually this is a spelling variation of the stage name
|    as used in credits or reference material or a maiden name. It's also not
|    an incorrect spelling variation of a name. These have to be corrected,
|    not mailed in as alternative names (see below). Please add (I/II/III...)
|    as necessary to distinguish between different people with the same name.
|    All names are in surname, first name(s) order (also Japanese,
|    Chinese etc.).

 TIMES

 <title>|<country>|<running-time>|<attributes>

where:

  <title> is the title for which you wish to add the running time.  This
     must be a fully qualified IMDb title.

  <country> is the country for which you wish to record the running time

  <running-time> field is used to record the duration of the movie.
     It includes the film and the credits, but excludes theatrical trailers
     and, if from a TV broadcast, adverts.
   
     Please note:

      1). Silent movies may be shown at slightly different speeds because at 
          that time there was no exact standard of speed (running times for 
          silent films were usually given in feet, but we won't go into such 
          details here), so different people might get different times.

      2). The European (PAL/SECAM) tv/video running times may be shorter by
          about 4% due to the fact that film runs at 24 frames, but European 
          video runs at 25 (North American (NTSC) video actually runs at 30, 
          but the transfer takes the 24/30 difference into account).
        
          That said, please do not submit times taken from video versions of
          films.  We only record running times for theatrical releases

  <attributes> field allows you to specify any special characteristics
     regarding the movie you are submitting.  Without an <attributes> field,
     the entry will default to the theatrical release.  Please only include
     other media versions if they differ from the theatrical release. 

     Valid attributes are:

       (LD)     - Laser Disc Version

       (video premiere)      - Movie never released theatrically
       (director's cut)      - Director's Cut
       (special edition)     - Special Edition
       (re-release)          - Rereleased, probably after a ban or cut

 A movie can obviously conform to several genres so please try to list them
 in order of significance with the primary genre first.

 Some examples of genres you shouldn't add:

  Incorrect genres                   Correct genres
  ----------------                   --------------
  Science Fiction                    Sci-Fi
  Serial Killer                      serial-killer
  Short Documentary                  Documentary
                                     + short
  Historical Drama                   Drama
                                     + historical
  Action, Thriller                   Action
                                     + Thriller
  COMEDY                             Comedy

  Also bear in mind that a movie is not necessarily a "Comedy" just
  because there are a few quick remarks or funny jokes in it.  It happens
  too often that movies are registered with incorrect genres.  It's not
  a disaster, but it is annoying for the person renting "Schindler's List"
  to watch a good "Horror" movie.

 - Please use the names as given in the credits. Avoid translating names 
   to modernised equivalents, e.g. if the film credits say 
   Czechoslovakia, please don't change it to Czech Republic.

 - This list is for filming locations i.e. where the filming took 
   place and not necessarily the location portrayed in the movie - so 
   DON'T add things like.. Total Recall (1990)|Mars 

 - Studio names/locations don't belong in this list. See the business 
   list for those.

 The movie links list records (often trivial) connections between movies in 
 the Internet Movie Database, the best example being sequel information. The 
 currently supported links are:

  Link           | Notes
  ---------------|---------------------------------------------------------
  followed by    | the movie has a sequel or in some way is followed by a
                 | future movie

  ---------------|---------------------------------------------------------
  remake of      | the movie is a remake of a previous movie
  ---------------|---------------------------------------------------------

| ---------------|---------------------------------------------------------
| spin off from  | some characters/situations from a previous movie were 
|                | used during the movie
| ---------------|---------------------------------------------------------


 For example:

 Alien (1979)
   (followed by Aliens)
 
 Alien 3
   (follows Aliens)
 
 Aliens
   (followed by Alien 3)
   (follows Alien (1979))

 As you can see, each forward link (lefthand column) has an equivalent 
 backward link (righthand column), the only exception is 'version of'. 
 To simplify the additions process you only need to specify one of the 
 directions and the processing software will generate the opposite 
 link automatically. For example:

  MOVIELINK
  Alien (1979)|followed by|Aliens
      
 the processing software will generate the additional line:

  Aliens|follows|Alien (1979)

 automatically when the data is incorporated into the database.

Examples
--------

 MOVIELINK
 Alien (1979)|followed by|Aliens (1986)
 Hot Shots! (1991)|spoofs|Top Gun (1986)
 When Harry Met Sally... (1989)|features|Casablanca (1942)
 Vertigo (1958)|referenced in|Kiss Before Dying, A (1991)
 Sense and Sensibility (1995)|version of|Sense and Sensibility (1985) (TV)

 PLOTS

Rules
-----

 1. Try to avoid any spoilers.   Some very small spoilers will be allowed, and
    are often necessary, but any biggies will annoy other readers when they
    find out the Butler didn't do it !
 
 2. Any analysis of the film should be left out of the plot summary.   e.g.
    "This film is one of Hitchcocks finest".   It is up to the viewer
    to decide if he/she likes it.   This includes performances by
    actors and actresses.
 
 3. Where possible, try not to use any actor or actress names in the plot 
    outline.   This is already taken care of in the movie database.   
    If possible, use the character names from the movie.   
 
 4. All copyrighted material is excluded from the plot outlines database.
    This includes Movie Guides, Newspapers, and even the blurb on the back
    of the video case.  
 
 5. You must stick to the pre-arranged format given below.   The plot summaries
    will be read in by a program, and will automatically be added to the 
    list.   Any non-conformant outlines may be discarded.
 
 6. Try and keep it reasonably short.   Less than 10 lines for the description
    if possible.
 
 7. Any queries about plots or the submitting of plots must have "PLOT QUERY"
    in the subject line.
 
 8. Please try and spell check any summaries you submit.
 
 9.Try and keep you BY: line consistent if you write more than one summary.
    You will never make it into the top 10 if you have 5 variations of your
    name/mail address.

 PL: work of H.R.Giger
 BY: Colin Tinto <cst@imdb.com>

  BIOGR

Description
-----------

 This is a guide to submitting biographies to the movie database. The 
 biographies database is used to record personal trivia such as real name,
 date of birth, date of death, mini-biography about the person's life, agent's
 address etc. It does *not* include the list of movies the person was involved
 with - these are held separately in the filmography databases. 

Rules
-----

  (1) All  copyrighted material is *excluded* from the BIOGRAPHY  database.
      This includes Movie Guides, Newspapers, Biographies etc.

  (2) You   must  stick  to  the  pre-arranged  format  given  below.   The 
      biographies  will be read in by a program, and will automatically  be 
      added to the list. Any non-conformant entries will be discarded.

  (3) Try and keep biographies reasonably concise.

Acceptable Trivia
-----------------

 Please ensure that what you submit is trivia, and not a ``goof''.  Also, we
 will only include trivia that has a direct bearing on the film it is
 classified under.

What kind of things go into the list?

   - In-jokes 
   - (Backwards) references to other movies 
   - Behind the scenes information 
   - Interesting connections 
   - Cameos, Director's Cameos, Director's Trademarks, Actor's Trademarks,

What kind of things DON'T go into the list?

   - Your (or anybody else's) opinion on what's in Marsellus Wallace's
     briefcase.
   - Your (or anybody else's) version of Vincent Vega's family tree.
   - Movie goofs, mistakes, boom-mikes, and/or anachronisms. 
   - Gossip and most rumours 
   - Gutter press scandal
   - Shooting dates/locations (there is a list specifically for this)
   - Authors whose work the film was based on (there is a list specifically
     for this)
   - Sequel/remake information (there is a list specifically for this)
   - Opinions, reviews, flames, or plot summaries
   - Forward references. Links between films should be stored under the later
     film. See _Trading Places_ (qv) and _Coming to America_ (qv). 

 You can also use the following tags:

 CAMEOS:
  A ``cameo'' is a small, unbilled role.  If their name appears in the credits,
  it's NOT a cameo.  A cameo is NOT defined a famous person with a small role,
  despite the fact that this may be interesting.  If they are billed, then
  please don't send it in as a ``cameo'', but decide if it's signifcant enough
  to be included in the trivia section.

 SMITHEE
  The DGA contracts that directors operate under require that a name be given
  for the director of a film.  If the actual director of the film wishes to
  disown the film, he or she typically uses the name ``Alan Smithee'' (An
  anagram for ``The alias men'').

 BOOTH
  Writers who refuse to have their name appear in the credits typically use
  the the standard pseudonym ``Judas Booth'' (derived from ``Judas'' and
  ``John Wilkes Booth'').

Format

  TRIVIA
  # Movie Name, The
  - 'Firstname Lastname' (qv) also appeared in _The Other Movie_ (qv), which is
    why in this film he cracks the joke ``They're the wrong trousers!  And
    they've gone wrong!''.
  - CAMEO(Name Name): blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
  - DIRTRADE(Name Name): blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
  - DIRTRADE(Name Name): [cream]: The lead character eats whipped cream

 There is a separate list for technical and plot errors in movies.  Please use
 the keyword "GOOF" when submitting goofs.

where TAG is:

CONT: Continuity errors.  Errors in technical detail, where the film
      objectively contradicts itself.

PLOT: Plot holes.  Errors in narrative structure as opposed to technical
      detail.

FACT: Concept in the film contradicts science or known facts.

DATE: Anachronisms; objects/concepts which hadn't existed at the time the
      film was set.

FAKE: Mistakes which reveal how the film makers composed a scene of the film.

BOOM: Boom mike visible in an interesting or unusual way.  A special case of
      CREW below.

CREW: Crew or equipment visible in shot.

SYNC: Audio/visual tracks don't match exactly.

GEOG: Errors in geography of *specific* places.

FAIR: Justification of scenes which are commonly (and incorrectly) believed
      to contain goofs.

MISC: Anything else


DO NOT INCLUDE: Goofs due to non-perfect special effects.  The list would
become too big, full of "that looks cheap/fake" entries.

DO NOT INCLUDE: Goofs regarding multiple time lines and/or time travel.

DO NOT INCLUDE: Information from copyrighted sources.

DO NOT INCLUDE: Goofs due to non-perfect special effects.  What looks bad
                today was state-of-the art yesterday.

DO NOT INCLUDE: Suicide rumours from The Wizard of Oz (1939)

DO NOT INCLUDE: Ghost rumours from 3 Men and a Baby (1987)

DO NOT INCLUDE: Luke Skywalker calling out "Carrie".


Notes
-----

 * visible boom mikes aren't really goofs unless they are appear in some
   unexpected way (eg reflection, hit actor on the head).

 * please make the goof report as short and specific as possible.

 * please use the appropriate tag!

 * some movies are filmed in the same aspect ratio as a television screen
   with 'safe areas' masked off which are not intended to be seen in the
   cinema. When shown on video, the safe area is opened up which accounts
   for boom mikes, wires and scaffolding seen in some movies. These 'safe
   area' goofs will be listed, but noted as such.

 * please remeber that this is the movie goofs list and not the movie
   gripes list so don't submit opinions on what should have happend
   in terms of plot development etc.

Example
-------

 GOOF
 # Aliens
 - CREW: When Bishop is skewered by the mother alien, you can see the string
   pulling the stinger through his body.
 - CONT: The yellow caution light on the loaded when the mother alien pulls
   it into the pit.
 - CREW: Bishop's ('Lance Henriksen' (qv)'s) body as he stops Newt being
   sucked out of the airlock.

QUOTES SECTION

Keyword

 QUOTE

Format
------

 # <title>
 <quotes>

Description
-----------

 * Include which movie the quotes are taken from.  The movie title must be
   consistent with the movie database, including the year of release.  Avoid
   AKA-titles.

 * Write in a script-like way (see the list below) and include both the actors'
   real names and the character names.  Both are needed to create hypertext
   links in the WWW interface.  Preferred format is:
 
           {Surname, First Name@Character Name}:  The quote.
 
 * Keep narration brief, but do narrate if necessary.

 * Don't submit any quote.  Please try to avoid spoilers, and only submit
   quotes which have a certain point to them.  It doesn't need to be a funny
   quote (but they most often will be), but it should be memorable (like Roy's
   last words in `Blade Runner').

 * Keep the QUALITY UP and the QUANTITY DOWN.

 * The quotes should be correct.  Correct spelling and written _exactly_ as
   it's said in the movie.  When this is not the case, I'm not necessarily the
   one to blame, but I am the one you should notify.

Example
-------

 QUOTE
 # Blues Brothers, The (1980)
 {Aykroyd, Dan@Elwood Blues}:  It's 106 miles to Chicago, we've got a full tank
 of gas, half a pack of cigarettes, it's dark and we're wearing sunglasses.
 {Belushi, John@Jake Blues}:  Hit it!

CRAZY CREDITS SECTION

Keyword
-------

 CRAZY

Format
------

 # <Movie Title>
 - <Text>   Each entry should start with a hyphen, followed by  a
   space  and  then  the  text  (no  more  than 65 characters per
   line). If subsequent lines refer to the  same  entry  then  no
   hyphen  is  required.  See  the  list below for more examples.
   Please try and keep movie titles consistent with  those  found
   in the database itself.

Description
-----------

 The crazy credits section contains a list of unusual things shown during a
 movie's credits. Sometimes these are extra scenes, more usually they are 
 funny messages hidden in the credits themselves. 

Example
-------

 # Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1992)
 - TV interviews with people who were at the dance attacked by vampires.
 - Amilyn (Paul Reubens) revives to go through some more death throes.
 
                      -------------------

SOUNDTRACKS SECTION
===================

Keyword
-------

 SOUND

Format
------

 # <movie title as listed in the movie database>
 - Music: <Composer, usually listed in the beginning of the movie>
 - "<title of song>"
   Written by <person(s)/group>
   Performed by <person(s)/group>
 - "<title of next song>"

Notes
-----

 * Include which movie the soundtrack information is taken from.  I would
   appreciate it if the movie title is consistent with the movie database,
   including the optional year of release.  Please avoid AKA-titles.

 * Please follow the format shown below.

 * The information should be correct.  Correct spelling, etc., exactly as
   it's shown in the movie.

 * Only include the information on soundtracks from the movie itself, not
   soundtrack LP's/CD's/etc...
   + The reason to include only the soundtrack information listed in the
     movie and not soundtrack information as it appears on soundtrack
     LP/CD releases is as follows:
     1) Many times a movie soundtrack is not released on LP/CD. 
     2) The music released on an LP/CD many times does not match the music
        in the movie. 
     3) Sometimes, many different soundtrack LP's/CD's are released, each
        one with different music on them. 
   + These are several of the reasons for only listing the music as it is
     listed in the movie credits.

     Please try to submit as many technical details as possible. If you
     do not find the information, you can simply leave out the corresponding
     field. Please do not leave out field for information which is not
     applicable, just use "-" as value. For example a disc without digital
     sound would get this entry:
     DS: -
     or a LaserDisc which is not under the THX program will get:
     TX: -

     This is important, because we want to know if it is a fact, that some
     information is not applicable or if some information is simply
     unknown.

   Description of the fields:

    "LN:" This is a unique LaserDisc number which identifies a LaserDisc.
          A LaserDisc number will be allocated by me, when you submit a
          new entry. Please use this field for updates only and do not fill
          in anything, if you are not exactly sure which number to use.
          Since this field marks the start of a new LaserDisc, you must
          not omit it. Just use use "LN: " without number for new titles.

    "LB:" This is the Label which released the LaserDisc. Please use the
          labels as they appear in the list below. If you find a new label
          which is not in the list, please let me know.

    "CN:" This is the catalogue number of the LaserDisc.

    "LT:" This is the title of the LaserDisc. If the LaserDisc is a movie
          and the disc is released in the original language, this title is
          the same as the title in the movie database, except that the
          information [(Year) (TV) (V) (mini) etc.] following the title
          is missing. For TV Series you also do not have to include the
          quotes (""). Please check if the original title on the film itself
          is consistent with the movie database. If not, you should also
          submit update entries to the movie database. See the FAQ for more
          information about how to submit movie entries and updates.
          If the LaserDisc is not in the original language or is not a
          movie, you should supply the title as it appears printed on the
          cover. For movie collections you submit the Title of the
          collection as printed on the cover.

    "OT:" This is the original title of a program as it appears in the
          movie database. If the LaserDisc is not a movie, a TV movie or a
          TV series, submit the same entry as under "LT:" <LaserDisc Title>.
          For movie collections submit an OT entry for each movie included
          in the collection.
          If possible, check if the movie is already in the movie database.
          Sometimes movies are known under different names, so you may have
          to query via actors or directors to find the right title. If the
          movie is not in the database, please submit as much data on the
          movie as you can find in the credits on the LaserDisc.
          See also "movies.list" for more information about the title
          formats to use.

          To demonstrate the diffence between the LaserDisc title and the
          original title here are some EXAMPLES:

          a) Movie title is the same as the LaserDisc title:
             LT: Piano, The
             OT: Piano, The (1993)

          b) LaserDisc title in a different langauge than movie title
             LT: Woman Next Door, The
             OT: Femme d'à côté, La (1981)

          c) Collection of movies in a box set:
             LT: Connery Collection, The
             OT: Dr. No (1962)
             OT: From Russia With Love (1963)
             OT: Goldfinger (1964)

          d) TV Series on LaserDisc:
             LT: Twilight Zone, The - Vol. 2
             OT: "Twilight Zone, The" (1959)

          e) Music video title:
             LT: Scorpions: First Sting
             OT: Scorpions: First Sting

    IMPORTANT NOTE on titles:
    Starting with the laserdisc.list we are introducing the ISO Latin 1
    character set for international characters. Please submit all titles
    for the LaserDisc database with international characters, if possible.
    Do not use ISO characters for the other lists yet!
    Your systems must have MIME installed to be capable of mailing 8 bit
    characters. Please use quoted printable encoding. If you do not have
    MIME, you can use constructs such as
    <"a>, <'e>, <^u> to submit a title.

    EXAMPLE:
    with MIME (ISO)       -  OT: Femme d'à côté, La (1981)
    without MIME (ASCII)  -  OT: Femme d'<`a> c<^o>t<'e>, La (1981)


    "PC:" This is the country which produced the program on the LaserDisc.
          Do not confuse this with country which has released a disc.
          For co-productions submit a PC entry for each country. See also
          "countries.list" for more information about the country formats.

    "YR:" This is the year of the first public screening of a program. For
          movies, use the same year as used in the movie title. See "OT:".

    "CF:" This is the certification of the LaserDisc in the country in which
          the LaserDisc was first released.

    "CA:" This is the category of the LaserDisc contents: Currently the
          following categories are used:

          LaserDisc Categories
          --------------------
          Movie
          Music
          Special Interest
          TV Series

          The keywords "Movie" and "TV Series" are mostly used for titles
          which are in the movie database. Please use "Movie" also for made
          for TV movies. Only TV series and mini series get "TV Series" as
          category.
          For animation collections such a "Golden Age of Looney Tunes,
          The - Vol. 1" you can choose between "Special Interest" and
          "Movie". If you choose to use "Movie", you have to make sure that
          each single cartoon is in the movie database, and if not, you
          should submit all relevant information about the cartoon. In this
          case, you also have to submit an "OT:" entry for each cartoon.
          If you only want to submit the collection as a whole, then use
          "Special Interest" and submit the same title under "OT:" as under
          "LT:". If possible, submit a listing of cartoon in the "IN:" field
          in this case.

    "GR:" This is the Group or Genre of the LaserDisc to further classify
          the program contents. For each category there are a number of
          groups. The following groups are currently in use:

          I try to keep this field consistent with the primary genre field
          of the movie database. I only support one primary genre, so please
          do not submit more than one "GR:" entry. In additon to the primary
          genres, there are the two additional genres "Adult" and "Anime".
          See the "genres.list" for information about updating the genres in
          the movie database.

    "LA:" This is the language of the audio on the LaserDisc. For bilingual
          programs submit two language entries. Do not use any abbreviations
          for languages, just write: English or Japanese etc.

    "SU:" This field contains the language of the subtitles or just -.

    "LE:" This is the length of the program in minutes.

    "RD:" This is the release date of the LaserDisc. Use one of these
          formats to submit dates: <day> <full month> <full year> or
          <full month> <full year> or <full year>. If you do not know
          the exact release date it is better to submit just the year
          than nothing. You can probably use the year which is stated
          under package design or the copyright of the distributor. It
          is usually the newest year printed on the cover.
          EXAMPLES: 21 January 1995, April 1994, 1985.

    "ST:" This is the availability status of a LaserDisc. Only the four
          keywords: Available, Out of Print, Announced and Cancelled are
          allowed here.

    "PR:" This is the retail price of the LaserDisc in the country in
          which the disc was first released. You also have to include the
          currency. For example: $ 34.98 (USA), DM 59.00 (Germany), FF 409
          (France), £ 19.99 (UK), Y 5100 (Japan), HK$ 200.00 (Hong Kong),
          NT$ 2200 (Taiwan).
          Since this field can also be used to find out in which country
          a disc was released, please submit the currency also when you
          do not know the retail price. For Example: $, DM, £, Y or HK$.

    "VS:" This is the video standard of the LaserDisc. Allowed values are:
          NTSC, PAL and HI-Vision.

          transcoded to PAL, use FILM anyway for this field, but add a note
          in the information field "IN:".

    "PP:" This is the pressing plant which has manufactured a LaserDisc. See
          the article LD09 by Bob Niland for information about how to find

          please add more information about which sides are CAV in the
          "IN:" field.

    "PF:" This is the picture format of a LaserDisc. The following values
          are used:

          Picture Format

          Video
          Academy Ratio
          Widescreen 16:9
          Pan & Scan 16:9

          "Unmatted" is used for open matte transfers. Please only use this
          value, if you are certain that every single frame is unmatted. If
          there is only a single special effects shot, which was cropped,
          the LaserDisc will get "Pan & Scan" entry.
          "Widescreen 16:9" is used for anamorphically or PAL Plus coded
          LaserDiscs. Do not use this keyword for Letterbox releases. If
          an anamorphic LaserDisc is Pan & Scanned (2.35:1 -> 1.78:1) it
          will get a "Pan & Scan 16:9" entry.

          values.
    
    "CS:" This is the number of chapter stops the LaserDisc contains. Use
          0, if the disc does not contain any chapter stops.

    "TX:" This field is used if a LaserDisc was mastered under the THX
          quality control program. Just submit THX or -.

    "IN:" This field contains additional information about the LaserDisc.
          Each line may contain up to 76 characters. There can be any
          number of "IN:" lines.
          Do not submit informations about the movie itself. You may however
          send a short description of the program contents, if the program
          does not belong into the movie database.
          You can add anything you want here. It is recommended that you
          supply information about the transfer quality and about
          supplements. Please make comments about the tranfer quality and
          bugs etc. before the Supplements section. Use a new paragraph
          to list the supplements and use the word "Supplements: " to
          indicate the start of the supplements list. List all supplements
          seperated by a semi-colon ';'. After this list you can add
          whatever comments you like about the supplements.

          EXAMPLE:
          
          IN: Sides 1 and 4 are CAV.  This disc has the rolling bar problem.
          IN: See also text _StarWarsFlaws_.
          IN: 
          IN: Supplements: Audio commentary by Demme, Foster, Hopkins,
          IN: screenwriter Ted Tally and FBI agent John Douglas; deleted
          IN: scenes; a film-to-storyboard comparison; storyboards; and
          IN: production stills.  These are followed by filmographies on
          IN: Demme, Hopkins, and Foster.  Pauline Kael apparently hosts the
          IN: Demme filmography.  Finally there are 8 chapters of FBI
          IN: material onserial killers.  Featuring several profiles such as
          IN: Organized sexualhomicide and so on.

          For TV series, cartoon collections and such add an episode listing.
          Place each episode name in quotes '"' and seperate them with a
          comma. Use the same spelling conventions as on movie titles.

          EXAMPLE:
          IN: Episodes: "Nightmare at 20000 Feet", "The Odyssey of Flight 33",
          IN: "Steel", "A Game of Pool".

          For music LaserDiscs please send a comma separated list of tracks
          beginning with "Videos: " if the disc contains video clips or
          "Live: " if the disc contains concert footage. If you want to
          add on which side the songs are you can use "Videos 1" or "Live 2"
          instead.

          EXAMPLES:
          IN: Videos: Change His Ways, Simply Irresistible, Tell Me...

          IN: Live 2: One Vision, Tie Your Mother Down, In The Lack Of The
          IN: Gods...

  VERSIONS
  # First Movie
  - blah blah blah
  - blah blah blah blah blah

  # Second Movie
  - blah blah blah
  - blah blah blah blah blah

Description
-----------

There are many kinds of alternate versions, the most common of which are:

DIRECTOR'S CUTS/SPECIAL EDITIONS: Contracts under the terms of the
Hollywood Director's Guild allow about six weeks for a director to assemble
a cut without studio interference.  This is fully edited and has a
synchronized sound track; however, it is usually not color-corrected nor
density-corrected and may not have the final music and effects track.  In
more recent times, due to an expanding video aftermarket, the term
director's cut has acquired a popular meaning that implies a finished final
print, officially prepared by the director or with his consent, and usually
including scenes not included in the original theatrical release. Many
director's cuts are re-released in theathers or on video. Examples: "Blade
Runner", "Aliens", "Close encounters of the third kind".

RESTORED VERSIONS: Classic movies are sometimes re-released (usually many
years after their original premiere) with never before seen or long-lost
restored scenes. Examples: "Spartacus", "Lawrence of Arabia", "The Wild
Bunch".

CENSORSHIP CHANGES: Censorship laws often impose changes or deletions
before a film can be given a certificate and released. In the U.S.A movies
are often cut after being submitted to the MPAA in order to avoid a X or NC-17
rating; sometimes the deleted scenes are restored for the video or laserdisc
release, or are left intact in the European release. Other countries have
different censorship standards: U.K. releases routinely cut any scene that
suggests violence or mishandling of animals (ex. the mouse sequence in "The
Abyss").

UNAUTHORIZED/UNOFFICIAL VERSIONS: Sometimes a movie is cut or otherwise
modified from the original version without the consent or the knowledge of
the filmmakers. A frequent occurrence is when a foreign distributor decides
to remove scenes to reduce the film's running time in order to get more
showings per day or to make it more appealing to the local audience, often by
including a different music score.

TELEVISION VERSIONS: Films, especially R-rated ones, are routinely cut or
altered before they can be shown on network television or airline planes to
delete objectionable language and frames or to fit a two-hour time slot.
These changes are routine, don't necessarily represent alternate versions and
will _not_ be considered here, unless very extensive. However, TV versions
which add new footage (ex. "1941"), significantly re-edit or change existing
material or substitute new scenes (ex. "Basic Instinct") in place of deleted
sequences will be listed.

BUSINESS INFORMATION SECTION
============================

Keyword
-------

  BUSINESS

Format
------

The fields available for submitting information are:

     MV: Movie Title (Year)
         The original title of the movie, followed by the year of release.

     BT: Movie Budget [Country] 
         Cost of production of the movie, optionally followed by the name of
         the country (for currency identification purposes). If Country is
	 omitted, the amount is in US dollars.

     GR: Box Office Gross (Territory) [Date]
         How much did the movie make at the box office. The figures must be
         followed by the country. "Non-Usa" means that the amount is the sum
         of all box office receipts from outside the USA. "Worldwide" means
         that the b.o. figures are the total of all revenues from all over
         the world, including the USA.
         All box office figures without a date are final (i.e. that's the
         total b.o. gross at the time the film was pulled out of release). 
         An optional date indicates when the box office figures were last
         updated and is generally used for films still in general release.
         All figures are _not_ adjusted for inflation or variations in
         movie ticket prices and are rough estimates, not definitive data.

     OW: Opening Weekend Box Office Take (Territory) [Date] [Screens]
         How much the movie took at the box office in its first weekend of
         release, followed by the country of release and optionally by the
         weekend date and number of theatres the movie opened in.
         Opening weekend takes are often a reliable indicator of a film's 
         future commercial performance.

     RT: Rentals
         Rentals are the money that goes back to the film distributor after
         its worldwide theatrical release and are therefore the best
         indicator of a movie's real commercial performance and strength.

     AD: Admissions (Territory)
         The number of tickets were actually sold at the box office in a
         specific country. 

     PD: Production Dates (Start-End)
         When filming took place. Use full date format and separate the
         production start and end dates with a hyphen.

     ST: Studio where movie was filmed (Country) 
         Studio facility where parts or all of the movie was shot, followed
         by the country. If filming took place in more than one studio, use
         separate lines for each of them.
         Warning: this field must be used for film studio facilities only
         (example: Universtal Studios in Hollywood, Warner Studios in
         Burbank, Pinewood Studios in UK, Cinecitta' in Rome, etc.) and
         _not_ for actual on-site shooting film locations (i.e. real places
         or cities). There is a separate LOCATIONS list, managed by Rob
         Hartill, in the Internet Movie Database that specifically includes
         that kind of information.

     CP: Copyright Holder and contact information.  
	 The name of the individual or company that owns the copyright over
         the movie, followed by the address/contact information (if
         available). Not to be confused with the studio or distribution
         company, this information is usually found at the very end of the
         films title credits.

Example

Here's an example (all data is bogus and for sample purposes only):

  MV: Fictional Title, A (1996)

  BT: $43,000,000 (USA)
  
  OW: $5,400,000 (USA) (3 March 1996) (450 screens)

MARKING THE END OF YOUR DATA
=============================

Finally, to finish off a message put the word END on a new line.

                      -------------------

SUBMITTING CORRECTIONS, DELETIONS AND COMMENTS
==============================================

The keyword interface can also be used to submit corrections to
existing entries, to remove erroneous entries and to make general comments
about the movie database or the information it contains. Again, you should
set the subject of your mail to the single word:

 ADD

and send the message to <add@imdb.com>.

Corrections and comments may be included in the same mail message as the
addition mail outlined in the previous sections.


Deleting and Correcting Specific Entries
----------------------------------------

To delete an existing erroneous entry in the database use the appropriate 
keyword as described in the previous sections, but mark the start of the line
with a '!' character. For example, imagine the database had an incorrect
entry for Geena Davis appearing in "The Grifters", to remove this you could use:

ACTRESS
!Davis, Geena|Grifters, The (1990)|

This facility can be used to correct specific errors in the database too. For
example, imagine the actors list had an incorrect entry for Alan Hale appearing
in "Hang 'em High", when in fact it was Alan Hale Jr., to make this correction 
you could have use:

ACTOR
!Hale, Alan|Hang 'em High (1967)|
Hale Jr., Alan|Hang 'em High (1967)|

The first line deletes the erroneous entry and the second adds the correct one.


Correcting Names Across the Whole Database
------------------------------------------

If you spot a spelling error in a name in the database, use the keyword

  NAMECORRECT

and the format:

  <current name>|<correct name>

For example:

   NAMECORRECT
   Bogart, Humphry|Bogart, Humphrey


Correcting Titles Across the Whole Database
-------------------------------------------

If you spot a spelling error in a title in the database, use the keyword

  TITLECORRECT

and the format:

  <current title>|<correct title>

For example:

  TITLECORRECT
  Flight of the Phoenix, The (1965)|Flight of the Phoenix (1965)
  Jurassic Park (1995)|Jurassic Park (1993)


General Comments and Corrections
--------------------------------

Keywords

 COMMENT = general comments/explanations on the data you've submitted
 CORRECT = corrections for the database

Description

 There is no format for either of these so just write in plain English. Please
 note that the processing software splits your mail into separate files by
 keyword, so make sure any comments/corrections make sense on their own and 
 do not depend on something you added under another keyword in order to be
 understood. 

 As an aid to the database managers, if your comments relate to a specific
 section, you may mark them as such by adding a hyphen ("-") after the
 COMMENT/CORRECT keyword followed by the corresponding section keyword.
 For example:

 COMMENT-ACTOR
 This is a comment specific to the actors database

 CORRECT-TRIVIA
 This is a correction specific to the trivia database


Moving People Between the Actors and Actresses List
---------------------------------------------------

We often have to guess the gender of people submitted via the CAST keyword
and sometimes entries end up in the wrong list.

To move an actor from the actresses list to the actors list, use:

MALE
<name>

To move an actress from the actors list to the actresses list, use:

FEMALE
<name>

Example:

FEMALE
Novak, Kim

                      -------------------

TRIVI
# Vertigo (1958)
- DIRCAMEO(Alfred Hitchcock): about 11 minutes in wearing a gray suit
  walking past Gavin Elster's shipyard.
- The film is based upon the novel ``D'Entre les Morts'' which was written
  specifically for Hitchcock after the authors heard that he tried to
  buy the rights to their previous novel ``Diabolique''.
- San Juan Batista, the Spanish mission which features in key scenes in the
  movie doesn't actually have a bell tower - it was added with trick
  photography. The mission originally had a steeple but it was demolished
  following a fire.
- The screenplay is credited to 'Alec Coppel' (qv) and 'Samuel Taylor' (qv),
  but Coppel didn't write a word of the final draft.  He is credited for
  contractual reasons only. Taylor read neither Coppel's script nor the
  original novel, he worked solely from Hitchcock's outline of the story.
- Hitchcock reportedly spent a week filming a brief scene where Madeleine
  stares at a portrait in the Palace of the Legion of Honor just to get the
  lighting right.
- Hitchcock invented the famous combination of forward zoom and reverse
  tracking shot to convey the sense of vertigo to the audience. The view
  down the mission stair well cost $19,000 for just a couple of seconds of
  screen time.
- Hitchcock originally wanted 'Vera Miles' (qv) to play Madeleine, but she
  became pregnant and was therefore unavailable.
- The film was unavailable for decades because its rights (together with four
  other pictures of the same periods') were bought back by Hitchcock and left
  as part of his legacy to his daughter. They've been known for long as the
  infamous ``5 lost Hitchcocks'' amongst film buffs, and were re-released in
  theathers around 1984 after a 30-years absence. They are
  _Rear Window (1954)_ (qv), _The Trouble with Harry (1955)_ (qv),
  _Rope (1948)_ (qv), _Vertigo (1958)_ (qv) and
  _The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956)_ (qv).
- DIRTRADE(Alfred Hitchcock): [bathroom] Madeline emerges from the bathroom,
  ready for lovemaking.
- DIRTRADE(Alfred Hitchcock): [hair] Carlotta and Madeline have spiral
  hairstyles, and Judy's hair color is significant.
QUOTE
# Vertigo (1958)
[First Line]
Cop: Give me your hand.  Give me your hand.

John 'Scottie' Ferguson: You shouldn't keep souvenirs of a killing.
  You shouldn't have been that sentimental.

John 'Scottie' Ferguson: Midge, who do you know that's an authority on
  San Francisco history?
Marjorie 'Midge' Wood: That's the kind of greeting a girl likes!  Not
  this 'Hello-you-look-wonderful'-stuff, just a good straight 'Who do
  you know that's an authority on San Francisco his...' [interrupted]
